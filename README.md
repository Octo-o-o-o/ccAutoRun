**An AI-powered task automation tool for Claude Code that turns complex development tasks into self-executing workflows.**

ccAutoRun v2.0 transforms Claude Code from an interactive assistant into a fully automated task executor. Generate intelligent execution plans with AI, then let the system automatically execute them stage-by-stage—while you focus on more important work.

---

## ✨ What Makes v2.0 Special?

### 🤖 AI-Generated Execution Plans
- Claude generates **complete, structured execution plans** for your tasks
- Automatic architecture selection (split or single-file) based on complexity
- Built-in validation ensures plan quality and efficiency
- No more manually breaking down complex tasks

### 🔄 True Zero-Intervention Automation
- Hook-based auto-continuation—moves to next stage automatically
- No manual `/clear` commands or copy-pasting needed
- Safety limits prevent runaway execution
- Pause/resume support for graceful interruption

<!-- TODO: Record GIF showing automatic stage progression -->

### 📊 Intelligent Architecture Choice
- **Split Architecture**: For complex tasks (>3 stages, >2500 lines)
  - Loads only current stage → 90%+ token savings
  - Each stage in separate file for clarity
- **Single-File Architecture**: For simple tasks (≤3 stages, <2500 lines)
  - Everything in one EXECUTION_PLAN.md
  - Quick to generate and execute
- **Auto-Select**: AI chooses the best architecture, or you can force one

### 🛡️ Production-Ready Safety
- **Sandbox mode**: File access and command execution limits
- **Safety limiter**: Configurable stage limits before manual review
- **Snapshot system**: Automatic backups before each stage
- **Error recovery**: Retry/skip/rollback options when things go wrong
- **Audit logging**: Track all operations for security compliance

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g ccautorun
```

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# Initialize in your project
cd /path/to/your/project
ccautorun init --setup-hooks

# This will:
# ✓ Create .ccautorun/ directory
# ✓ Configure Claude Code hooks
# ✓ Set up default configuration
# ✓ You're ready to go!
```

### Generate Your First Plan

In Claude Code, use the `/plan` slash command:

```
/plan I need to refactor the authentication module to use JWT tokens instead of sessions
```

Claude will:
1. Analyze your codebase
2. Generate a multi-stage execution plan
3. Choose the optimal architecture
4. Save the plan to `.ccautorun/plans/`

### Execute the Plan

Claude will automatically start executing the plan. The system will:
- ✅ Execute Stage 1
- ✅ Auto-continue to Stage 2
- ✅ Auto-continue to Stage 3
- ⏸️ Pause at safety limit for your review

You'll get desktop notifications at key milestones!

## 🏗️ Architecture Decision Guide

### When to Use Split Architecture

**Best for:**
- Complex multi-stage tasks (4+ stages)
- Large codebases (>10,000 lines)
- Tasks requiring detailed planning
- Long-running refactors

**Benefits:**
- 90%+ token savings (loads only current stage)
- Better organization (one file per stage)
- Easier to review and modify
- Scales to 20+ stages easily

**Example:** Refactoring authentication system, migrating to new framework

### When to Use Single-File Architecture

**Best for:**
- Simple tasks (≤3 stages)
- Quick fixes or updates
- Focused, well-defined tasks
- Small scope changes

**Benefits:**
- Faster to generate
- Easier overview of entire plan
- Less file management
- Quick to modify

**Example:** Updating config file, fixing a specific bug, generating simple docs

### Auto-Select (Recommended)

Let Claude choose the best architecture:

```
/plan <your task>
```

Claude analyzes:
- Task complexity
- Estimated LOC
- Number of stages needed
- Your project size

And automatically picks the optimal architecture!

## 🛡️ Security & Safety

### Sandbox Mode (Default)

- **File Access Control**: Restricts access to project directory only
- **Command Whitelist**: Only safe commands (git, npm, node) allowed
- **Sensitive File Protection**: Auto-excludes .env, credentials, keys
- **Audit Logging**: All operations logged for review

### Safety Limits

- **Stage Limit**: Pauses after N stages (default: 3) for manual review
- **Execution Timeout**: Prevents hanging stages
- **Snapshot Backups**: Auto-backup before each stage
- **Error Detection**: Stops on critical failures

### Dangerous Mode

For advanced users who need unrestricted access:

```bash
# Use with caution!
ccautorun init --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Only use with plans you fully trust!
